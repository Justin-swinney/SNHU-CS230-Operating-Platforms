**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

- The Gaming room is seeking a web-based game application called Draw it or Lose it, this software should support one or more teams with multiple players in each team. Only one instance of the game should exist in memory, and the teams and users must have unique names. 


**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

- I felt I did well in addressing the client’s requirements and included all technical details with justification, as well as ensuring the document was clear to follow. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

- I found a design document that provided a clear list of instructions. If I was to develop this code some decision making would be easier to make as the requirements would identify the best source to use to meet the needs of the client and the document would provide guidance throughout the development of this code. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

- As far as improvements go, I feel I could have improved on the Domain Model section of this document by providing a more detailed explanation of how the classes interact with one another. As well as highlighting the advantages of the domain model. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

- Reading the users requirements for the application allowed me to interpret their needs by understanding the application needed cross platform compatibility, multiple teams and users, unique identifications, and the overall game mechanics. Understanding the user’s need is crucial to ensure the application created is to their standards therefore satisfying the customer. Meeting the user requirements, the application created is functional and meets the user’s needs and goals. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

- I approached the designing of the software with a user-centered design and requirement analysis to ensure requirements were met and the application would fulfill their needs. In the future I would implement a more agile development approach to allow for any changes requested by the user to be accommodated and overall create a more efficient software development process.
